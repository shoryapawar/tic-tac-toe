# tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe Game made by only vanilla javascript.

A fully working tic-tac-toe game anyone can play it on PC.
this is the first stage of it I'll add some more things in it like CSS to beautify it and some other feautres also .

<h3> The game starts with circle and then the cross can be played until the three circle or three crosses 
occrs horizontaly or verticaly or diagonaly if it happens then the one which occurs first WINS!!!</h3>
